        "description": ".. image:: https://raw.github.com/eugene-eeo/eventstream/master/art/logo-300.png\n   :alt: Eventstream\n\nEventstream is an embedded events storage component based on SQLite.\nIt allows you to store events and query them based on time, making\nit trivial in storing data which is time based. Events are represented\nas tags with optional metadata attached, which allows you to model\nmost data effectively.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    from eventstream import connect, Event\n\n    t = connect(uri=':memory:')\n    t.emit(Event('status.update'), 1)\n\n    today = datetime.utcnow()\n    yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)\n\n    t.find.since(yesterday)\\\n          .to(today)\\\n          .tagged('status.*')\n\nLike Graphlite, Eventstream is thread safe. All ``emits`` are atomic\nand operate under a lock (if you want to store many events use the\ntransaction-based ``emit_many`` instead). Eventstream also emphasizes\non API usability and overall ease of use. You can query by time, tag,\nor node, but not the metadata.\n\n------------\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you want to contribute, we follow the Github workflow, so\nfork the repo, work on the code and just make a pull request\n(make sure all tests pass beforehand, at least in the last\ncommit of your pull request). In short:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/$USERNAME/eventstream.git\n    $ cd graphlite\n    $ git checkout -b $FEATURE\n    $ # hackedy hack hack\n    $ py.test tests\n    $ git commit -a\n    $ git push\n\nNote that we use ``py.test`` for testing so if you haven't,\nmake sure you ``pip install pytest``. But you should.\n\n* **Code Status:** |Build|\n* **Maintainer:** `Eugene Eeo`_\n* **License:** MIT\n\n.. |Build| image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/eugene-eeo/eventstream.svg\n.. _Eugene Eeo: http://github.com/eugene-eeo",
