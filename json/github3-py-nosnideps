``github3.login`` has been simplified and split into two functions:\n\n  - ``github3.login`` serves the majority use case and only provides an \n    authenticated ``GitHub`` object.\n\n  - ``github3.enterprise_login`` allows GitHub Enterprise users to log into \n    their service.\n\n- ``GitHub#iter_followers`` was split into two functions:\n\n  - ``GitHub#followers_of`` which iterates over all of the followers of a user\n    whose username you provide\n\n  - ``GitHub#followers`` which iterates over all of the followers of the\n    authenticated user\n\n- ``GitHub#iter_following`` was split into two functions:\n\n  - ``GitHub#followed_by`` which iterates over all of the users followed by\n    the username you provide\n\n  - ``GitHub#following`` which iterates over all of the users followed by the\n    authenticated user\n\n- ``GitHub#iter_gists`` was split into three functions:\n\n  - ``GitHub#public_gists`` which iterates over all of the public gists on \n    GitHub\n\n  - ``GitHub#gists_for`` which iterates over all the public gists of a \n    specific user\n\n  - ``GitHub#gists`` which iterates over the authenticated users gists\n\n- ``GitHub#iter_orgs`` was split into two functions:\n\n  - ``GitHub#organizations`` which iterates over the authenticated user's\n    organization memberships\n\n  - ``GitHub#organizations_with`` which iterates over the given user's\n    organization memberships\n\n- ``GitHub#iter_subscriptions`` was split into two functions:\n\n  - ``GitHub#subscriptions_for`` which iterates over an arbitrary user's\n    subscriptions\n\n  - ``GitHub#subscriptions`` which iterates over the authenticated user's \n    subscriptions\n\n- ``GitHub#iter_starred`` was split into two functions:\n\n  - ``GitHub#starred_by`` which iterates over an arbitrary user's stars\n\n  - ``GitHub#starred`` which iterates over the authenticated user's stars\n\n- ``GitHub#user`` was split into two functions:\n\n  - ``GitHub#user`` which retrieves an arbitrary user's information\n\n  - ``GitHub#me`` which retrieves the authenticated user's information\n\n- ``GitHub#update_user`` has been renamed to ``GitHub#update_me`` and only\n  uses 1 API call now. It was renamed to reflect the addition of\n  ``GitHub#me``.\n\n- The legacy watching API has been removed:\n\n  - ``GitHub#subscribe``\n\n  - ``GitHub#unsubscribe``\n\n  - ``GitHub#is_subscribed``\n\n- ``GitHub#create_repo`` was renamed to ``GitHub#create_repository``\n\n- ``GitHub#delete_key`` was removed. To delete a key retrieve it with\n  ``GitHub#key`` and then call ``Key#delete``.\n\n- ``Repository#set_subscription`` was split into two simpler functions\n\n  - ``Repository#subscribe`` subscribes the authenticated user to the \n    repository's notifications\n\n  - ``Repository#ignore`` ignores notifications from the repository for the \n    authenticated user\n\n- ``Repository#contents`` was split into two simpler functions\n\n  - ``Repository#file_contents`` returns the contents of a file object\n\n  - ``Repository#directory_contents`` returns the contents of files in a\n    directory.\n\n- ``Organization#add_repo`` and ``Team#add_repo`` have been renamed to\n  ``Organization#add_repository`` and ``Team#add_repository`` respectively.\n\n- ``Organization#create_repo`` has been renamed to\n  ``Organization#create_repository``. It no longer accepts ``has_downloads``.\n  It now accepts ``license_template``.\n\n- ``Organization#remove_repo`` has been renamed to\n  ``Organization#remove_repository``. It now accepts ``team_id`` instead of\n  ``team``.\n\n- ``github3.ratelimit_remaining`` was removed\n\n- ``GitHub`` instances can no longer be used as context managers\n\n- The pull request API has changed.\n\n  - The ``links`` attribute now contains the raw ``_links`` attribute from the\n    API.\n\n  - The ``merge_commit_sha`` attribute has been removed since it was deprecated\n    in the GitHub API.\n\n  - To present a more consistent universal API, certain attributes have been\n    renamed.\n\n===============================     ==========================\nOld name                            New attribute name\n===============================     ==========================\n``PullFile.additions``              ``additions_count``\n``PullFile.deletions``              ``deletions_count``\n``PullFile.changes``                ``changes_count``\n``PullRequest.additions``           ``additions_count``\n``PullRequest.comments``            ``comments_count``\n``PullRequest.commits``             ``commits_count``\n``PullRequest.deletions``           ``deletions_count``\n``PullRequest.review_comments``     ``review_comments_count``\n===============================     ==========================\n\n- The Gist API has changed.\n\n  - The ``forks`` and ``files`` attributes that used to keep count of the\n    number of ``forks`` and ``files`` have been **removed**.\n\n  - The ``comments`` attribute which provided the number of comments on a\n    gist, has been **renamed** to ``comments_count``.\n\n  - The ``is_public`` method has been removed since it just returned the\n    ``Gist.public`` attribute.\n\n- Most instances of ``login`` as a parameter have been changed to ``username``\n  for clarity and consistency. This affects the following methods:\n\n  - ``github3.authorize``\n  - ``github3.repositories_by``\n  - ``github3.user``\n  - ``GitHub``\n  - ``GitHub#authorize``\n  - ``GitHub#follow``\n  - ``GitHub#is_following``\n  - ``GitHub#is_starred``\n  - ``GitHub#issue``\n  - ``GitHub#followers_of``\n  - ``GitHub#followed_by``\n  - ``GitHub#gists_by``\n  - ``GitHub#issues_on``\n  - ``GitHub#organizations_with``\n  - ``GitHub#starred_by``\n  - ``GitHub#subscriptions_for``\n  - ``GitHub#user``\n  - ``GitHubEnterprise``\n  - ``Issue#assign``\n  - ``Organization#add_member``\n  - ``Organization#is_member``\n  - ``Organization#is_public_member``\n  - ``Organization#remove_member``\n  - ``Repository#add_collaborator``\n  - ``Repository#is_assignee``\n  - ``Repository#is_collaborator``\n  - ``Repository#remove_collaborator``\n  - ``Team#add_member``\n  - ``Team#is_member``\n  - ``User#is_assignee_on``\n  - ``User#is_following``\n\n- ``Repository.stargazers`` is now ``Repository.stargazers_count`` (conforming\n  with the attribute name returned by the API).\n\n\n- The ``Issue`` API has changed in order to provide a more consistent attribute\n  API. ``Issue.comments`` is now ``Issue.comments_count`` and returns the\n  number of comments on an issue.\n\n- The ``Issue.labels`` attribute has also been renamed. It is now available from\n  ``Issue.original_labels``. This will provide the user with the list of\n  ``Label`` objects that was returned by the API. To retrieve an updated list\n  of labels, the user can now use ``Issue#labels``, e.g.\n\n  ::\n\n      i = github3.issue('sigmavirus24', 'github3.py', 30)\n      labels = list(i.labels())\n\n- The ``Organization`` and ``User`` APIs have changed to become more\n  consistent with the rest of the library and GitHub API. The following\n  attribute names have been changed\n\n===============================     ==========================\nOld name                            New attribute name\n===============================     ==========================\n``Organization.followers``          ``followers_count``\n``Organization.following``          ``following_count``\n``Organization.public_repos``       ``public_repos_count``\n``User.followers``                  ``followers_count``\n``User.following``                  ``following_count``\n``User.public_repos``               ``public_repos_count``\n===============================     ==========================\n\n- The ``Release.assets`` attribute has been renamed to\n  ``Release.original_assets``. To retrieve up-to-date assets, use the\n  ``Release#assets`` method.\n\n- The ``Authorization`` API has changed. The ``update`` method has been split\n  into three methods: ``add_scopes``, ``remove_scopes``, ``replace_scopes``.\n  This highlights the fact that ``Authorization#update`` used to require more\n  than one request.\n\n- ``Event#is_public`` has been removed. Simply check the event's ``public``\n  attribute instead.\n\n- ``Repository#delete_file`` and ``Repository#update_file`` have been removed.\n  Simply delete or update a file using the Contents API.\n\n- ``Content#delete`` now returns a dictionary that matches the JSON returned\n  by the API. It contains the Contents and the Commit associated with the\n  deletion.\n\n- ``Content#update`` now returns a dictionary that matches the JSON returned\n  by the API. It contains the Contents and the Commit associated with the\n  deletion.\n\n- ``Issue.pull_request`` has been renamed to ``Issue.pull_request_urls``\n\nNew Features\n````````````\n\n- Most objects now have a ``session`` attribute. This is a subclass of a\n  ``Session`` object from ``requests``. This can now be used in conjunction\n  with a third-party caching mechanism. The suggested caching library is\n  ``cachecontrol``.\n\n- All object's ``url`` attribute are now available.\n\n- You can now retrieve a repository by its id with\n  ``GitHub#repository_with_id``.\n\n- You can call the ``pull_request`` method on an ``Issue`` now to retrieve the\n  associated pull request::\n\n      import github3\n\n      i = github3.issue('sigmavirus24', 'github3.py', 301)\n      pr = i.pull_request()\n\n\n",
