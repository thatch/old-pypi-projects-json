        "description": "# The DARC Toolbox: automated, flexible, and efficient delayed and risky choice experiments using Bayesian adaptive design.\n\nRun efficient Bayesian adaptive experiments using Python and the [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org) experiment framework.\n\nThis code relates to the following pre-print. But, the pre-print is likely to appear in quite a different form when finally published.\n> Vincent, B. T., & Rainforth, T. (2017, October 20). The DARC Toolbox: automated, flexible, and efficient delayed and risky choice experiments using Bayesian adaptive design. Retrieved from psyarxiv.com/yehjb\n\n**Status:  \ud83d\udd25 Under active development \ud83d\udd25**\n\n# Features\n\n- Easily run a range of decision making experiments using PsychoPy. These include delayed decisions (inter-temporal choice), risky choice tasks, and combined delayed and risky choice tasks.\n- Get more accurate measures from fewer trials.\n- Rich exports: Get trial-level data, estimated parameters from your chosen decision making model(s), and visualisation of results.\n- Easy customisation of experiment details within PsychoPy.\n\nAdvanced features are available with some simple edits to the Python code:\n\n- Customise your prior beliefs over model parameters to fit your participant population.\n- Simultaneously fit mulitple models to an experimental participant.\n- Inject custom trials: if you have particular experimental needs, you can inject your own (manually specified) designs amongst automatically run trials.\n\n# Installation instructions\n1. Ensure you have a Python 3 installation. I recommend https://www.anaconda.com/download/, you should be fine with Python 3.6.6 or later versions.\n2. Install [PsychoPy 3.0.0](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/tag/3.0.0). I recommend running one of their demo experiments to confirm that it is working correctly.\n3. Download or clone this `darc-experiments-python` repository.\n4. Open up PsychoPy... Open the PsychoPy experiment `psychopy/demo/experiment.psyexp` in the builder view... Run the experiment. You will get some GUI options to chose from before the experiment starts. After it is finished, check the auto-saved data in the `\\data` folder. This includes log files, saved trial-level data, and exported figures which could be useful.\n\n# Adaptive Experiment = Experimental Design Space + Cognitive Model\nAn adaptive experiment is a combination of a set of allowable designs (questions) which we call the **design space** and a **cognitive model**. The Bayesian Adaptive Design methods select which design to present to participants on a trial-to-trial basis, in real time. The goal of this is to maximise the information we gain about our model parameters.\n\nA range of experimental designs and cognitive models are provided and are detailed below.\n\n## Experimental design paradigms\nOne of the core components of this package is to provide designs chosen through Bayesian Adaptive Design, as outlined in our prepint (Vincent & Rainforth, 2017). The core classes of design we focus on are:\n\n- **Delayed choice tasks (aka inter-temporal choice):** You can choose between various protocols such as: front-end delays, fixed delayed reward, fixed immediate reward, fixed delay, etc.\n- **Risky choice tasks:** Choose your range of reward probabilities. These can also be seen as a transformed version of odds against recieving a reward.\n- **Simultaneous delayed and risky choice tasks:** Again, you can customise the range of delays and reward probability (risk) levels used in your experiment.\n\nAll of these paradigms are available, and can be fine tuned, using our Bayesian Adaptive procedure.\n\nHowever we also provide the ability to run some other prominent experiment design procedures from the literature. These are:\n- The Kirby (2009) delay discounting procedure.\n- The 5 trial procedure outlined by Koffarnus & Bickel (2014).\n- The adaptive procedure from Du, Green & Myerson (2002) for delayed and risky choice tasks.\n- The 'delay slice' procecure from Frye et al (2016), closely related to the approach of Du, Green & Myerson (2002).\n- The delay and risky choice procedures from Griskevicius et al (2011).\n\n\n## DARC Cognitive models available\n\nYou can in run adaptive experiments to make very efficient inferences about the parameters for models of your choice. See below for a list of completed models. See the [model-related GitHub issues](https://github.com/drbenvincent/darc-experiments-python/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amodel) to see what is in progress.
