In the System menu, click Preferences, then click Network Connections.\n#. Select the connection for which you want to configure Google Public DNS.\n   For example:\n\n   - To change the settings for an Ethernet connection, select the Wired tab,\n     then select your network interface in the list. It is usually called eth0.\n   - To change the settings for a wireless connection, select the Wireless tab,\n     then select the appropriate wireless network.\n\n#. Click Edit, and in the window that appears, select the IPv4 Settings or IPv6\n   Settings tab.\n#. If the selected method is Automatic (DHCP), open the dropdown and select\n   Automatic (DHCP) addresses only instead. If the method is set to something \n   else, do not change it.\n#. In the DNS servers field, enter the following IP: ``127.0.0.1``.\n#. Click Apply to save the change. If you are prompted for a password or \n   confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.\n\nRestart Network Manager::\n\n  #> service network-manager restart\n\nTry running eoe::\n\n  #> eoe\n\nIf it fails it messaging telling that the port is occupied, you are screwed.\nThe only way I know to make it work is to ``pkill dnsmasq`` thus in the \ncrontab you also need to kill ``dnsmasq``.\n\nIf you want to have ``eoe`` always running just add it to your crontab with\n``@reboot`` as its time field::\n\n  #> sudo crontab -e\n\nAnd then add the following line::\n\n  @reboot eoe\n\nIf you don't launch ``eoe`` at boot time, you will need to run it yourself, when\nneeded with the following command::\n\n  sudo eoe\n\nWhen the ``eoe`` is not running you need to reconfigure network manager to use \nfull dhcp.\n\nPlease take the time to read the \n`documentation of avahi <http://avahi.org/wiki/AvahiAndUnicastDotLocal#Workarounds>`_ \nregarding the hosts trick.\n\nThis is really usefull if you deal with a **lot** of subdomains and that your\nnetwork use dynamic IPs which change regularly.",
