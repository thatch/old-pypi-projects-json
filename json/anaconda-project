These conditions could include:\n\n * creating a conda environment with certain packages in it\n * prompting the user for passwords or other configuration\n * downloading data files\n * starting extra processes such as a database server\n\nThe goal is that if your project runs on your machine, it will\nalso run on others' machines (or on your future machine after you\nreboot a few times and forget how your project works).\n\nThe command `anaconda-project init DIRECTORY_NAME` creates an\n`anaconda-project.yml`, converting your project directory into an\nAnaconda project.\n\n## Put another way...\n\nTraditional build scripts such as `setup.py` automate \"building\"\nthe project (going from source code to something runnable), while\n`anaconda-project` automates \"running\" the project (taking build\nartifacts and doing any necessary setup prior to executing them).\n\n## Why?\n\n * Do you have a README with setup steps in it? You may find that\n   it gets outdated, or that people don't read it, and then you\n   have to help them diagnose the problem. `anaconda-project`\n   automates the setup steps; the README can say \"type\n   `anaconda-project run`\" and that's it.\n * Do you need everyone working on a project to have the same\n   dependencies in their conda environment? `anaconda-project`\n   automates environment creation and verifies that environments\n   have the right versions of packages.\n * Do you sometimes include your personal passwords or secret keys\n   in your code, because it's too complicated to do otherwise?\n   With `anaconda-project`, you can `os.getenv(\"DB_PASSWORD\")` and\n   configure `anaconda-project` to prompt the user for any missing\n   credentials.\n * Do you want improved reproducibility? With `anaconda-project`,\n   someone who wants to reproduce your analysis can ensure they\n   have exactly the same setup that you have on your machine.\n * Do you want to deploy your analysis as a web application? The\n   configuration in `anaconda-project.yml` tells hosting providers how to\n   run your project, so there's no special setup needed when\n   you move from your local machine to the web.\n\n## Learn more from the complete docs\n\nCheck out the complete documentation, including a tutorial\nand reference guide, at:\nhttp://anaconda-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n\n## If you've been using `conda env` and `environment.yml`\n\n`anaconda-project` has similar functionality and may be more\nconvenient. The advantage of `anaconda-project` for environment\nhandling is that it performs conda operations, _and_ records them\nin a config file for reproducibility, in one step.\n\nFor example, if you do `anaconda-project add-packages bokeh=0.11`,\nthat will install Bokeh with conda, _and_ add `bokeh=0.11` to an\nenvironment spec in `anaconda-project.yml` (the effect is comparable to\nadding it to `environment.yml`). In this way, \"your current conda\nenvironment's state\" and \"your configuration to be shared with\nothers\" won't get out of sync.\n\n`anaconda-project` will also automatically set up environments for a\ncolleague when they type `anaconda-project run` on their machine; they\ndon't have to do a separate step to create, update, or activate\nenvironments before they run the code. This may be especially\nuseful when you change the required dependencies; with `conda env`\npeople can forget to re-run it and update their packages, while\n`anaconda-project run` will automatically add missing packages every\ntime.\n\nIn addition to environment creation, `anaconda-project` can perform\nother kinds of setup, such as adding data files and running a\ndatabase server. It's a superset of `conda env` in that sense.\n\n# Stability note\n\nFor the time being, the Anaconda project API and command line syntax\nare subject to change in future releases. A project created with\nthe current \u201cbeta\u201d version of Anaconda project may always need to be\nrun with that version of Anaconda project and not conda\nproject 1.0. When we think things are solid, we\u2019ll switch from\n\u201cbeta\u201d to \u201c1.0\u201d and you\u2019ll be able to rely on long-term interface\nstability.\n\n# Bug Reports\n\nPlease report issues right here on GitHub.\n\n# Contributing\n\nPlease see CONTRIBUTING.md in this directory.\n\n",
