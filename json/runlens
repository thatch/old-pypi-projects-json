        "description": "==================\n What is RunLens?\n==================\n\nRunLens is an alternative for the application lens that is used in\nUbuntu's Unity desktop to start applications.\n\nRunLens doesn't show \"*Apps available for Download*\" and \"*Most\nFrequently used*\" sections. Instead it only lists installed\napplications sorted by relevancy to the search query.\n\nIn addition to the program's name and icon it shows a short\ndescription for every application.\n\n========\n Get it\n========\n\nRunLens ist available at `<http://www.florian-diesch.de/software/runlens/>`_\n\n\n========\n Status\n========\n\nRunLens is  Alpha software. It works for me but I \nexpect it to have quite some bugs.  **Use it at your own risk.**\n\nIf you find a bug in RunLens please report it at the `bugtracker at\nLaunchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/runlens/+filebug>`_ so that I\ncan fix it. Thank you.\n\n\n============\nRequirements\n============\n\nRunLens is developed and tested on Ubuntu 11.10 \"Oneiric Ocelot\"\n\nRunLens needs the following packages from the software sources:\n\n- python-gmenu \n- python-gobject\n- python-whoosh\n\nIf you install the .deb package this packages will be automatically\ninstalled if needed.\n\n\n=========\n License\n=========\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
