It ensures the tests have been run\n(and are passing), reminds the user to update the version numbers in the\npackage, asks the user for the version and creates a git tag with it, and then\nuploads the release.\n\n```yaml\n- desc: Run the tests\n  command: tox\n\n- desc: Update the version number in setup.py\n\n- desc: Update the version number in chk/__init__.py\n\n- desc: Create a git tag for the current version\n  command: \"git tag -a 'v{version}' -m 'Version {version}'\"\n  args: ['version']\n\n- desc: Upload the release to PyPI\n  command: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload\n```\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n```bash\npip3 install chk\n```\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n```bash\nchk [-y] [.chk.yml]\n```\n\nSee `chk --help` for more information.\n\nLicence\n-------\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Sam Clements <sam@borntyping.co.uk>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
