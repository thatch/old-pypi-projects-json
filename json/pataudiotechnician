        "description": "# PAT Audio Technician (PAT)\nPAT is a Python library used to play audio files. If you have audio files and want to play them using \nPython, PAT the Audio Technician is at your service.\n\n## How does it work?\nPAT uses ffmpeg for audio decoding and resampling. SDL is used to play audio using the sound card. \nEverything is written in C, but the Python C Extension interface allows PAT to be used through the \nCPython interpreter.\n\n## How do I install it?\n1.  Install Python\n2.  Install ffmpeg\n3.  Make sure the ffmpeg shared libraries (.dll/.so) are available for linking with PAT (On Linux, \n    this means that they are in a shared library location. On Windows, this means that they are on \n    the PATH.)\n4. Install pataudiotechnician using PIP\n\n## How do I use it?\nPAT is currently under very active development, and the API WILL BREAK on occasion; however, one \ncan currently play audio files.\n```python\n>>> import pat\n\n# Queue an Audio File for Playback\n>>> pat.queue('deerdance.m4a')\n\n# Find Out How Many Bytes are Queued in the Audio Buffer\n>>> len(pat)\n41848832\n\n# Stop Playback\n>>> pat.stop()\n```\n\n## Can PAT be used with programming languages other than Python?\nAll of the Python-specific code is just a wrapper, so porting PAT would be relatively easy. If \nyou are using C/C++, you can use the functions declared in pat.h and link with ffmpeg. Any other \nprogramming languages can use the Python wrapper as a guide for porting efforts.\n\n## Licensing Considerations\nYou must link against an LGPL version of ffmpeg if you wish to bound by the terms of the LGPL.\n\n",
