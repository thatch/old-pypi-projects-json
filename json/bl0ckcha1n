They allow you to\ngenerate bitcoin/dogecoin/litecoin addresses without exposing your private key to a\npotentially insecure server.\n\nTo link a user with a new bitcoin address, you just need to provide the user's\nID to the ``create_new_address_for_user`` method:\n\nTL;DR\n-----\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    ## DO THIS ON AN OFFLINE MACHINE, NOT YOUR WEBSERVER\n    from bl0ckcha1n.wallet import Wallet\n\n    # Create a wallet, and a primary child wallet for your app\n    my_wallet = Wallet.new_random_wallet()\n    print(my_wallet.serialize_b58(private=True))  # Write this down or print it out and keep in a secure location\n    project_0_wallet = my_wallet.get_child(0, is_prime=True)\n    project_0_public = project_0_wallet.public_copy()\n    print(project_0_public.serialize_b58(private=False))  # Put this in your app's settings file\n\n\n    ## THINGS BELOW ARE PUBLIC FOR YOUR WEBSERVER\n\n    # In your app's settings file, declare your public wallet:\n    WALLET_PUBKEY = \"<public output from above>\"\n\n    # Create a payment address for a user as needed:\n    from bl0ckcha1n.wallet import Wallet\n    from myapp.settings import WALLET_PUBKEY\n\n    def get_payment_address_for_user(user):\n        user_id = user.id\n        assert isinstance(user_id, (int, long))\n        wallet = Wallet.deserialize(WALLET_PUBKEY)\n        wallet_for_user = wallet.create_new_address_for_user(user.id)\n        return wallet_for_user.to_address()\n\n.. _security:\n\nSecurity warning\n----------------\n\n\nBIP32 wallets have a vulnerability/bug that allows an attacker to recover the\nmaster private key when given a master public key and a publicly-derived\nprivate child. In other words:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from bl0ckcha1n.wallet import Wallet\n\n    w = Wallet.new_random_wallet()\n    child = w.get_child(0, is_prime=False)  # public derivation of a private child\n    w_pub = w.public_copy()\n    master_public_key = w_pub.serialize_b58(private=False)\n    private_child_key = child.serialize_b58(private=True)\n\nGiven ``master_public_key`` and ``private_child_key``, the steps to recover the\nsecret master private key (``w``) are as simple as a subtraction on the\nelliptic curve. This has been implemented as ``Wallet.crack_private_key``,\nbecause if it's possible to do this, then anyone should be able to do it so the\nattack is well known:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    public_master = Wallet.deserialize(master_public_key)\n    private_child = Wallet.deserialize(private_child_key)\n    private_master = public_master.crack_private_key(private_child)\n    assert private_master == w  # :(\n\nThis attack can be mitigated by these simple steps:\n\n#. NEVER give out your root master public key.\n#. When uploading a master public key to a webserver, always use a prime child\n   of your master root.\n#. Never give out a private child key unless the user you're giving it to\n   already has control of the parent private key (eg, for user-owned wallets).\n\nWhy \"always use a prime child of your master root\" in step 2? Because prime\nchildren use private derivation, which means they cannot be used to recover the\nparent private key (no easier than brute force, anyway).\n\nCreate a new wallet\n-------------------\n\nIf you haven't created a wallet yet, do so like this:\n\n**IMPORTANT** You must back up your wallet's private key, otherwise you won't\nbe able to retrieve the coins sent to your public addresses.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from bl0ckcha1n.wallet import Wallet\n\n    my_wallet = Wallet.new_random_wallet()\n\n    # Then back up your private key\n\n    private_key = my_wallet.serialize()\n    print(private_key)\n    # Make sure that you can load your wallet successfully from this key\n    wallet_test = Wallet.deserialize(private_key)\n    assert my_wallet == wallet_test\n    # If that assertion fails then open a ticket!\n    # NOW WRITE DOWN THE PRIVATE KEY AND STORE IT IN A SECURE LOCATION\n\nNote that it's a good idea to supply some extra entropy to `new_random_wallet`\nin case your PRNG is compromised. You can accomplish this easily by banging on\nthe keyboard. Here's an example, yours should be *much* longer:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from bl0ckcha1n.wallet import Wallet\n\n    wallet1 = Wallet.new_random_wallet('asdfasdfasdf')\n    wallet2 = Wallet.new_random_wallet('asdfasdfasdf')\n    assert(wallet1.get_private_key_hex() != wallet2.get_private_key_hex())\n\n    # They're completely different\n\nBIP32 wallets (or hierarchical deterministic wallets) allow you to create child\nwallets which can only generate public keys and don't expose a private key to\nan insecure server. You should create a new prime child wallet for every\nwebsite you run (or a new wallet entirely), and perhaps a new prime child for\neach user (though that requires pre-generating a bunch of prime children\noffline, since you need the private key). Try to use prime children where\npossible (see `security`_).\n\nIt's a good idea to create at least *one* prime child wallet for use on your\nwebsite. The thinking being that if your website's wallet gets compromised\nsomehow, you haven't completely lost control because your master wallet is\nsecured on an offline machine. You can use your master wallet to move any funds\nin compromised child wallets to new child wallets and you'll be ok.\n\nLet's generate a new child wallet for your first website!\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Lets assume you're loading a wallet from your safe private key backup\n    my_wallet = Wallet.deserialize(private_key)\n\n    # Create a new, public-only prime child wallet. Since you have the master\n    # private key, you can recreate this child at any time in the future and don't\n    # need to securely store its private key.\n    # Remember to generate this as a prime child! See the security notice above.\n    child = my_wallet.get_child(0, is_prime=True, as_private=False)\n\n    # And lets export this child key\n    public_key = my_wallet.serialize_b58(private=False)\n    print(public_key)\n\nYou can store your public key in your app's source code, as long as you never\nreveal any private keys. See the `security`_ notice above.\n\nBe aware that if someone gets a hold of your public key then they can generate\nall of your subsequent child addresses, which means they'll know exactly how\nmany coins you have. The attacker cannot spend any coins, however, unless they\nare able to recover the private key (see `security`_).\n\nGenerating new public addresses\n-------------------------------\n\nBIP32 wallets allow you to generate public addresses without revealing your\nprivate key. Just pass in the user ID that needs a wallet:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from bl0ckcha1n.wallet import Wallet\n    from myapp.settings import WALLET_PUBKEY  # Created above\n\n    master_wallet = Wallet.deserialize(WALLET_PUBKEY)\n    user_wallet = master_wallet.create_new_address_for_user(user_id)\n    payment_address = user_wallet.to_address()\n\nThis assumes that ``user_id`` is a unique positive integer and does not change\nfor the life of the user (and is less than 2,147,483,648). Now any payments\nreceived at ``payment_address`` should be credited to the user identified by\n``user_id``.\n\nStaying secure\n==============\n\nPublic Keys\n-----------\n\nPublic keys are mostly safe to keep on a public webserver. However, even though\na public key does not allow an attacker to spend any of your coins, you should\nstill try to protect the public key from hackers or curious eyes.  Knowing the\npublic key allows an attacker to generate all possible child wallets and know\nexactly how many coins you have. This isn't terrible, but nobody likes having\ntheir books opened up like this.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, knowledge of a master public key and a non-prime private\nchild of that key is enough to be able to recover the master private key. Never\nreveal private keys to users unless they already own the master private parent.\n\nYour master public key can be used to generate a virtually unlimited number of\nchild public keys. Your users won't pay to your master public key, but instead\nyou'll use your master public key to generate a new wallet for each user.\n\nPrivate Keys\n------------\n\nYou must have the private key to spend any of your coins. If your private key\nis stolen then the hacker also has control of all of your coins. With a BIP32\nWallet, generating a new master wallet is one of the only times that you need\nto be paranoid (and you're not being paranoid if they really *are* out to get\nyou). Paranoia here is good because if anyone gets control of your master\nwallet they can spend all funds in all child wallets.\n\nYou should create your wallet on a computer that is not connected to the\ninternet. Ideally, this computer will *never* be connected to the internet\nafter you generate your private key. The safest way to do this is to run Ubuntu\non a livecd, install python and bl0ckcha1n, and generate a new wallet.\n\nOnce you generate a new wallet you should write down the private key on a piece\nof paper (or print it out ...but can you *really* trust your printer?) and\nstore it in a secure location.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    sudo apt-get install python\n    sudo apt-get install pip\n\n    pip install bl0ckcha1n\n    pip install ipython\n\n    # Then launch the ipython shell\n    ipython\n\nOnce inside your ipython shell, generate a new wallet:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from bl0ckcha1n.wallet import Wallet\n\n    my_wallet = Wallet.new_random_wallet()\n\n    # Then back up your private key\n\n    private_key = my_wallet.serialize()\n    print(private_key)\n    # Write down this private key.\n    # Double check it.\n    # Then shut down the computer without connecting to the internet.\n\nMaster private key\n------------------\n\nYour master private key allows you to spend coins sent to any of your public\naddresses. Guard this with your life, and never put it on a computer that's\nconnected to the internet.\n\nMaster private keys must NEVER be put on the internet. They must NEVER be\nlocated on a computer that is even *connected* to the internet. The only key\nthat should be online is your PUBLIC key. Your private key should be written\ndown (yes, on paper) and stored in a safe location, or on a computer that is\nnever connected to the internet.\n\nSecurity wise, this is the most important part of generating secure public\npayment addresses. A master private key is the only way to retrieve the funds\npaid to a public address. You can use your master private key to generate the\nprivate keys of any child wallets, and then transfer those to a networked\ncomputer as necessary, if you want slightly smaller surface area for attacks.\n\nForthcoming versions of bl0ckcha1n will allow you to generate transactions\noffline that you can safely transfer to a networked computer, allowing you to\nspend your child funds without ever putting a private key on a networked\nmachine.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nAll of these work, though I typically use nosetest:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    python setup.py test\n    nosetests\n    python -m unittest discover\n\nNote\n-------\n\nThis repository is a fork of `BlockIo's multimerchant-python <https://github.com/BlockIo/multimerchant-python>`_,\nwhich was forked from Steven Buss's work, `Bitmerchant <https://github.com/sbuss/bitmerchant>`_.\n",
