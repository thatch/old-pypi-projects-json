        "description": "Turquoise\n=========\n\n.. warning::\n\n   Turquoise is still in development and will see major changes as it evolves.\n\nTurquoise is a CLI utility for performing blue-green deploys on AWS Auto\nScaling Groups.  When invoked, it will create a new auto scaling group with the\nspecified AMI, wait until all instances have booted and are passing health\nchecks (including ELB health checks if applicable), and the delete the old auto\nscaling group.\n\nAlthough Amazon CloudFormation has a rolling update feature for auto scaling\ngroups, it does not take into account ELB health checks, which can cause\nperiods where no instances registered in the load balancer are healthy, leading\nto downtime.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYou'll need two things to use Turquoise:  a base name and an AMI.\n\nThe base name is an string of your choosing. Turquoise will use the base name\nto construct a name for the new auto scaling group.  The new name is the base\nname plus a hyphen plus the current unix timestamp.  For example, if your base\nname is ``my-asg``, a new auto scaling name might be ``my-asg-1459314750``.\n\nThe base name will also be used to find the current auto scaling group.\nTurquoise will search for auto scaling groups that a name equal to the base\nname or a valid name constructed from the base name.  If multiple auto scaling\ngroups are found, the one with the latest timestamp will be used.\n\nTo obtain an AMI ID, we recommend using Packer_ to\nautomate building an AMI.  However, any valid AMI will work.\n\nWith those in hand, using Turquoise is easy::\n\n    turquoise [base name] [ami id]\n\nTurquoise uses boto_, so you can\nauthenticate yourself with AWS using the `credentials file`_ or\n`environment variables`_.\n\nGive it a few minutes to finish running and you'll have a new auto scaling\ngroup running instances with your new AMI.\n\n.. _Packer: https://www.packer.io/\n.. _boto: https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n.. _`credentials file`: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-config-files\n.. _`environment variables`: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-environment",
