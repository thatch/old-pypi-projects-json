Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gdsyuna/badge/?version=latest)](http://gdsyuna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n[![Travis-CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/heitzmann/gdsyuna.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heitzmann/gdsyuna)\n[![Appveyor Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/pr49a6bhxvbqwocy?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/heitzmann/gdsyuna)\n[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/heitzmann/gdsyuna/total.svg)](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdsyuna/releases)\n\ngdsyuna is a Python  module for creating/importing/merging GDSII stream files.\nIt includes key libraries for creating complex CAD layouts:\n\n* Boolean operations on polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) based on clipping algorithm\n* Polygon offset (inward and outward rescaling of polygons)\n* Efficient point-in-polygon solutions for large array sets\n\ngdsyuna also includes a simple layout viewer.\n\nTypical applications of gdsyuna are in the fields of electronic chip design, planar lightwave circuit design, and mechanical engineering.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Dependencies:\n\n* [Python](http://www.python.org/) (tested with versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6)\n* [Numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)\n* [Python-future](http://python-future.org/) (only for Python 2)\n* C compiler (needed only if built from source)\n\n### Linux / OS X\n\nOption 1: using [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/):\n\n```sh\npip install gdsyuna\n```\n\nOption 2: download the source from [github](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdsyuna) and build/install with:\n\n```sh\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nThe preferred option is to install pre-compiled binaries from [here](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdsyuna/releases).\n\nInstallation via `pip` and building from source as above are also possible, but an appropriate [build environment](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers) is required for compilation of the C extension modules.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe complete [documentation](http://gdsyuna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can be built from the sources in the `docs` folder with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).\n\nThe file [tutorial.py](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdsyuna/blob/master/examples/tutorial.py) in the `example` folder is a sample script to show the features provided by this module.\n\n## Support\n\nHelp
