        "description": "Painterm\n========\n\nA curses-based pixel art tool.\n\nMore correctly, painterm is a actually a scriptable bitmap image editor which also provides a curses-based command line interface.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPainterm requires Python 3.5. If you already have that, installation is as:\n```sh\npip3 install painterm\n```\n\nor cloning this repository and running:\n```sh\npython3.5 setup.py install\n```\n\nApplication\n-----------\n\nOnce installed, the `painterm` command will run the application. The applicatiion provides 4 function:\n\n *  `new`: Create a new image\n *  `load`: Load an existing image\n *  `bmp`: Export to a .BMP file\n *  `pxon`: Export to a .PXON file\n\nControls\n========\n\n *  `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`: Move the cursor\n *  `space`: Draw a pixel at the current location\n *  `f`: Flood fill at the current location\n *  `z`: Undo the most recent draw (persists across sessions)\n *  `Z`: Redo the most recent undone draw (persists across sessions)\n *  `1-9`: switch to the nth-most-recently-used colour\n *  `[ABCDEFHIKLMNORST][abcdefhiklmnorst]` change colour to selected palette colour (e.g., `At` will switch to a white).\n *  `d`: switch to the colour under the cursor\n *  `s`: Toggle snail mode (moving the cursor will cause it to draw first)\n *  `q`: Quit painterm\n\nPainterm saves automatically, so don't worry about it.\n\nLibrary\n-------\n\nThe heart of the painterm library is the `Image` class (found in `painterm.image`). It represents a bitmap image as an sqlite3 database. New images can\nbe created using:\n```python\nimage = Image.new_image(width, height)\n```\n\nThis will load a new image into an in-memory database (the `path` argument can be used to pass a `pathlib.Path` to save the database to). This file can later be loaded using `Image.load`\n\nBy default, the image will have a transparent-white background, but an alternative can be set using the `background` keyword. Colours in painterm are supplied as a four-tuple of (red, green, blue, alpha), where red, green, and blue are integers between 0 and 255, and alpha is a floating point number between 0 and 1. When returning colours, painterm will actually return the `painterm.colour.Colour` namedtuple.\n\n`Image` provides two drawing methods: `draw`, and `fill`. Both take `x`, the 0-indexed horizontal coordinate, `y`, the 0-indexed vertical coordinate, and `colour`, an rgba 4-tuple.\n\nReading of pixels can be done using the `colour_at` method, which takes `x` and `y` as arguments, and returns the colour as a namedtuple.\n\nThe image can be resized using the `resize` method. If new pixels are added, they will be given the initial background colour. If pixels are removed, their history will be removed with them.\n\n`undo`, `redo` exist and will step back or forward one transaction (probably, one call to `draw`, or `fill`, although both methods take an argument `continue_transaction` to allow multiple actions to be taken as one).\n\nImages can currently be exported to either a BMP (using the `export_bitmap` method), or PXON (using the `export_pxon` method). There is not currently a way to import image files.\n\nLicense\n-------\nPainterm is provided under the Mozilla Public License 2.0",
