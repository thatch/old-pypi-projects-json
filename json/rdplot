        "description": "RDPlot \n=======================\n\nRdPlot is a tool for plotting rate distortion curves.  \n\nFurther information can be found in `src/rdplot/README.md\n<https://github.com/IENT/RDPlot/blob/master/src/rdplot/README.md>`_.\n\nBuild status\n=======================\n.. image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/y4gvft2pb3vmm4qe/branch/master?svg=true\n\nCode Coverage\n=======================\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/IENT/RDPlot/badge.svg?branch=master\n:target: https://coveralls.io/github/IENT/RDPlot?branch=master\nsee for  `<https://coveralls.io/github/IENT/RDPlot>` details\n\nInstallation\n========================\n\nIn the following sections different installation strategies are outlined:\n\nOn this level of the repository you can build a python package which is \ninstallable via pip3.\n\nYou can also build an app for OS X.\n\nLinux \n=======================\n\nThe following was tested with Ubuntu 16.04. It should be similar for other\ndistributions.\n\nFirst of all there is a conflict between the python3-matplotlib package for\nUbuntu and matplotlib installed from pip. \n\nRDPlot will only work with matplotlib\ndirectly installed from pip and python3-matplotlib not installed on the system.\n\nMake sure that you are using python 3 and pip is up to date.\n\nSadly but true, we need a few dependencies.  \nYou need to install them with::\n\n    sudo apt-get install python3-jsonpickle python3-tk  python3-pip  python3-setuptools\n    \nand then::\n\n    python setup.py sdist\n\nNow you can install rdplot, either as user or system wide.\nInstall it system wide::\n\n    sudo pip3 install --no-binary rdplot dist/rdplot-1.0.0.tar.gz\n\nAs user. This will install the binary to ~/.local/bin/rdplot. Make sure it is \nin your PATH. The desktop launcher also will work only if this is the case::\n\n   pip3 install --user --no-binary rdplot  dist/rdplot-1.0.0.tar.gz\n\nIf you already have the tool installed run::\n\n     sudo pip3 install --no-binary rdplot --upgrade dist/rdplot-1.0.0.tar.gz \n     \n     \nNow you should be able to run rdplot from the command line and have a\nlauncher in your favourite desktop enviroment.\n\nIf you do not want to build the distribution but a simple install run::\n    \n    sudo python setup.py install\n    \nDocker\n=======================\nIf you prefer to run RDPlot in a Docker container, no problem::\n    \n    docker build rd-plot-gui/\n    docker run -ti --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix CONTAINERID\n    \nMake sure that you added your user to the docker group. If the container cannot connect to the display run::\n    \n    xhost local:docker\n    \nand try again. It should work.\n\n**Note:** Most probably the dockerized version is something for enthusiasts. \nThe image needs approx. 1.4 GB of disk-space. If you wanna spend that, enjoy!\n\nMac OS X\n=======================\n\n**Note:** things are not tested for Mac. You may have to fiddle a little bit.\nPlease contribute, if you have ideas for improvements.\n\nFirst of all you need to install python3.\nYou can get it `here  \n<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. \n\nMoreover, install all the requirements::\n    \n    cd src/rdplot\n    pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\nAddtionally install py2app::\n    \n    pip3 install py2app\n\nThen navigate back to the top level and build an app in alias mode::\n    \n    cd ../..\n    python3 setup.py py2app -A\n    \nNow you should have an app in the dist folder.\n\n**Note:** This app contains hard links to the directory with the source.\nIt is strongly recommended to clone the whole directory to your Applications folder.\nThen you can simply build the app and launch it from the internal search.\nAnother possibility is to put an alias in your Applications folder and/or attach it to the Dock.\n\nIf you want to update the app, it is fairly easy:\nNavigate to the local copy of the repository (now most probably in your Applications folder) and then::\n\n    git pull\n    python3 setup.py py2app -A\n    \nDone!\n\nUnistall is also simple: Just delete the local copy of the repositories and all aliases.\n    \n\n\nRunning from repository without installation\n========================\n\nLinux \n=======================\n\nYou can start rdplot from the command line with::\n    PYTHONPATH=~PATH_TO_RDPLOT/src/ python PATH_TO_RDPLOT/src/rdplot/__main__.py\n    \nIf you want to start the tool out of an IDE like PyCharm, make sure that you have set the PYTHONPATH environment variable correctly.",
